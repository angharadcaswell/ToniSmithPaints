        <h1>Timeless</h1>
        <h3>My first framed painting was Nearly There – the view of the railway tracks going into the tunnel from the Bray to
        Greystones cliff walk. Then after I painted Walking the Walk – the view of Greystones from the cliff walk, I realised
        that some scenes are truly timeless. And so, the Timeless collection was born.</h3>

                        line below. It sits lies high above the railway tracks and follows the same route with the most glorious sea views and
                        scenery. Covered in gorse and wild flowers it's a popular tourist attraction and a daily walk/run for many locals. I
                        painted this scene and was delighted when Cafe Grey in Greystones bought it to display in their shop. It is a timeless
                        and iconic view.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Growing up in Greystones in the 1970s the Men's was the best place to swim when the
                            tide was in. Mary Hackett had won
                            her amazing battle to allow everyone to swim there (although it has still retained the name!). We would
                            cycle along the
                            seafront from the south beach, or from the harbour and cove, and quickly lean our bikes against the wall
                            in a rush to
                            see if the tide was perfect for diving off the board and swimming. An old friend commissioned this
                            painting, and to
                            bring it to life she and another friend retraced their steps parking their bikes where we would have put
                            them. Sadly the
                            diving board is buried under feet of sand for most of the year! I have painted this scene many times it
                            evokes similar
                            memories for others from a certain era.</p>

                        memory I started with the approach down the steps to the wall when the anticipation and excitement mounted. The foliage
                        just makes for a more magical scene. I have painted this scene twice - one painting is happily hanging in Australia, the
                        other in Greystones.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">The coastal train ride from Dublin to Greystones is one of the top 10 things to do when
                        visiting Ireland. The last leg
                        of the journey from Bray to Greystones is truly spectacular. The railway line hugs the cliffs - a feat
                        of engineering
                        laid out by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in the 1850s. It cuts through tunnels before emerging into
                        Greystones. As you enter
                        the tunnels you know you were 'nearly there, nearly home. This special original painting hangs in my
                        home as a gentle
                        reminder of what is to come.

                        the bus came down through Windgates. When someone who grew up near Greystones, now living in Cyprus, asked me to capture
                        the view I knew exactly what she meant. The haybales in D'Arcy's fields, the rolling fields reaching down to the North
                        beach and the harbour beyond. It is a Timeless view and a wonderful memory.</p>

                            felt by many people unable to be with friends and family. Painting the beautiful Greystones view filled me with hope
                            that things will get better. I loved using unpredictable colours to bring the wall to life, and gems to lift the colour
