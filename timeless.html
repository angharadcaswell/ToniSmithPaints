        <h1>Timeless</h1>
        <h3>My first framed painting was Nearly There – the view of the railway tracks going into the tunnel from the Bray to
        Greystones cliff walk. Then after I painted Walking the Walk – the view of Greystones from the cliff walk, I realised
        that some scenes are truly timeless. And so, the Timeless collection was born.</h3>

                        were used as a navigation aid for pilots. I was commissioned to paint this stunning scene from Bellevue Hill, by someone
                        who lives in Delgany and wanted the view captured inside as well as when out walking.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Growing up in Greystones in the 1970s the Men's was the best place to swim when the tide was in. Mary Hackett had won
                        her amazing battle to allow everyone to swim there (although it has still retained the name!). We would cycle along the
                        seafront from the south beach, or from the harbour and cove, and quickly lean our bikes against the wall in a rush to
                        see if the tide was perfect for diving off the board and swimming. An old friend commissioned this painting, and to
                        bring it to life she and another friend retraced their steps parking their bikes where we would have put them. Sadly the
                        diving board is buried under feet of sand for most of the year! I have painted this scene many times it evokes similar
                        memories for others from a certain era.</p>

                        memory I started with the approach down the steps to the wall when the anticipation and excitement mounted. The foliage
                        just makes for a more magical scene. I have painted this scene twice - one painting is happily hanging in Australia, the
                        other in Greystones.p>

                            photo taken recently and asked her how she remembered it. I omitted the modern parts of the
                            photo and painted in the
                            bits as she remembered, consulting with her throughout. I used glass gems for the flowers to
                            bring a bit of magic to the
                            finished product. I have painted a similar scene for another client, and one with boys on
                            bikes for two other clients I
                            LOVE this scene, full of anticipation about what beach we will swim in!</p>

                            funded and liaised with the council to make this possible, giving us youngsters a perfect

                            about four different photos to create this painting. I have painted it a few times, and it

                            we descended the steps, past the hebe bushes and yucca plants and looked over the wall. Then
                            we could see if the tide
                            was in, if we could dive off the board, swim out to the raft, and see who else was there to
                            hang out with.</p>
