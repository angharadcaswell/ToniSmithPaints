        need are grey stones, changing seas, tides, winds (maybe some sun!), with the Sugarloaf mountains, Bray Head and
        Kindlestown woods forming the protective backdrop to the Greystones community.</h3>

                        popular painting request. Originals hang in homes in Greystones, Delgany, Dublin, America, and Germany. I used the
                        pointallism (small dots) technique with gems to bring texture to the pebbly sand, and flicking white paint with a
                        toothbrush makes great spray!</p>

                                to paint it over three canvas panels. It wasn't dry on the canvas and someone called to my house to deliver something,
                                saw it and bought it!</p>

                                accessible accommodation in Greystones, but it is also the most wonderfully serene place, situated on the harbour in the
                                heart of Greystones. Built in 1850, it provided safe and affordable accommodation for young women in domestic service
                                and shop workers. Transformed to meet today's diverse needs it still remains consistent to its values. Growing up in
                                Greystones the Y provided amazing summer fun with the CSSM, the highlight was the building of the most enormous
                                sandcastle on the South Beach. At Coolnagreina I meet so many people from all over the world returning home to visit
                                family and others on holidays or retreats. When I stay there and watch the sun go down between Little Sugarloaf and
                                Kindlestown Wood I know that the sun will rise tomorrow and hopefully there will always be a 'tomorrow' for me to come
