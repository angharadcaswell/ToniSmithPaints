                    <p>Thank you so much for your lovely paintings Toni. I love them all – I have quite a few from
                    your collection now. Each one holds treasured memories from my youth and paths well-trodden.</p>
                    <p class="d-none d-md-block">When I look at them from my armchair I am immediately transported back in time. It
                    is just wonderful to be able to look at them- not just in my mind’s eye but now thanks to you
                    they take pride of place in my home.<p> What a great gift you have.</p> <p class="d-none d-md-block">Thank you again.</p>

                    <p>When I opened my securely packaged painting I just smiled with delight. Toni had created
                    with amazing accuracy one of my favourite views in Donegal. I was transported to that spot
                    immediately. "Time to Breath" is literally and metaphorically what happens after the climb up
                    to this special viewing spot. When discussing the naming of the painting I laughed when Toni
                    immediately suggested that name. Love IT!</p>

                    <p> Toni's work transports you back to the freedom of childhood in Greystones while also
                    capturing the colours and shoreline of the town. I have bought cards, calendars, and prints
                    for myself, friends and family and they are all treasures. Her ‘Gone for a swim’ original
                    painting hangs in my home office. Toni has an artist's eye for detail and for bringing the
                    seashore to life.</p>

                    <p>Toni Smith’s brush is a time machine!
                    She transports me back in time with my commission of The Docks. It is the place where we
                    learned to swim and, in the painting, I felt the warm sunshine on old rocks. I could taste the
                    salt water and see my brothers and sister on the pier. It is not just evocative painting; Toni’s
                    paintbrush is indeed a time machine.</p>

                    in Godrevy, Cornwall - I can almost hear the waves! Wonderful service and communication

                    <p>My two friends commissioned a painting from Toni for my 50th birthday - it is the three of us
                    enjoying our daily swim at The Cove – ‘This is us’. Toni captured the pebble-strewn beach,
                    the ever-changing blues of the sea, and the breaking white surf. To look at the painting is to
                    hear the seagulls and feel the warm sun and the icy water. The enjoyment of our daily
                    plunge may be difficult to convey verbally but Toni's painting says it all.</p>

                        <p>In our childhood, we spent a lot of time in Greystones and Toni's paintings are amazing
                        flashbacks to those times. Very nostalgic memories are beautifully captured in her work,
                        both focussed on Greystones, its surroundings, and Wicklow in general. We commissioned a
                        painting of The Docks, where we learned to swim, and it did not disappoint. We keep a
                        supply of her cards and calendars – they are hugely appreciated by friends and family who
                        remember those days and places with affection. Toni's work really captures those times and
                        places.</p> <p class="d-none d-md-block">She provides a very efficient framing service as well as reliable and timely delivery.
                        We will be back, given the excellent selection of Toni's wide range of work.</p>

                        nothing short of amazing. Called "Tom Foolery in Greystones" it depicts riding bikes down to
                        the beach with her late brother Derek. Not alone is the painting visually wonderful it has a
                        very emotional aspect that Toni captured by her insight, creativity, and painting ability. It is
                        also the August picture in the 2021 calendar!</p>

                            <p>I commissioned a painting of a place called Ardmore, Co. Waterford which held a special
                            place in my friend’s heart for her 60th birthday. Despite Toni never seeing the place and
                            relying on a photograph Toni captured it perfectly.  So much so that Ann now hangs it in her
                            bedroom so she can see it when she wakes every morning. Dealing with Toni was a delight. 
                            Communication was always clear, and payment and delivery were easily achieved.
                            Thank you, Toni, for providing such a special and memorable gift.</p>

                                <p>Toni’s work is just fantastic. I have commissioned two paintings – Rush to the raft, and
                                Autumn concerto in sea. Her paintings bring the beauty spots in Greystones back to life.
                                They arrived ahead of schedule. I have also bought prints of When we were young and The
                                Way it Was along with a regular supply of cards. I send her calendars to family overseas
                                and have one pinned to my kitchen board!
                                I would recommend Toni’s work to anyone. A HUGE talent.</p>

                                    <p>Toni has captured the fondest memories of the sea at Greystones, which was always more
                                        than the physical place for those of us lucky enough to have the Mens as our playground. I commissioned three Greystones paintings.
                                        Toni's use of colour in her Australian pic of Warnambool, Vic. shows her skill with painting
                                        from photographs as well as from memory and imagination. Her paintings are a pleasure to
                                        have around my home, giving moments of delight when my eyes rest on them in the course
                                        of my day.</p>

                                    <p> We have always admired Toni’s work and great talent and regularly buy her cards and
                                        calendar. We were excited to commission a picture of a favourite seascape from our
                                        childhood days and where we still live and swim with our own family. Toni even painted our
                                        daughter going for a swim into it! The painting arrived on time, nicely framed, and now hangs
                                        in our home where it gives us great pleasure every day. It is something we treasure. Toni
                                        captures the scene and atmosphere beautifully, as she does in all her works. We hope she
                                        continues to paint more of these beautiful scenes.</p>
