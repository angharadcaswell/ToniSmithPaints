        <h1>The way it was</h1>
        <h3>My first request for a painting was from someone who had two photos of the Men’s, Greystones from ‘back in the day’. She
        set me the challenge of recreating the scenes on canvas. I called these paintings The Way it Was and When We Were Young.
        That was the starting point for having different collections. I so enjoy recreating scenes from people’s memories.</h3>

                colours of sky and sea with crashing waves making it totally unswimmable. I have painted it for quite a few people and
                sold many prints of it. Originals hang in homes in Australia, Greystones and Dublin.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Children in the 1960s, 1970s and much earlier all learned to swim in the docks. Learning to swim from one set of steps
                to to soft sandy shore on the other, swimming lessons were the best fun. Once mastered the next step was to jump off the
                pier into the harbour, swimming over to the slip. Then when the Kish came along there were many adventures to be had
                there. (Then the very daring made it to the back of the harbour wall!). I painted this commission first for an old
                Greystonian who lives in Wimbledon, England, but I have painted it many times since and have photos of it hanging in
                Delgany, Greystones and Bray.</p>

                    photo taken recently and asked her how she remembered it. I omitted the modern parts of the photo and painted in the
                    bits as she remembered, consulting with her throughout. I used glass gems for the flowers to bring a bit of magic to the
                    finished product. I have painted a similar scene for another client, and one with boys on bikes for two other clients I
                    LOVE this scene, full of anticipation about what beach we will swim in!</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Every summer a raft magically appeared, perfectly positioned so we could jump off the diving board and swim out to it.
                    It was many, many years before we realised that a very kind gentleman who lived directly opposite the Men's organised,
                    funded and liaised with the council to make this possible, giving us youngsters a perfect summer. Thanks Mr Davy! I used
                    about four different photos to create this painting. I have painted it a few times, and it is in homes in Greystones and
                    Dublin.</p>

                    had no idea what was on the other side of the wall. It always felt calm and serene, unable to answer our questions until
                    we descended the steps, past the hebe bushes and yucca plants and looked over the wall. Then we could see if the tide
                    was in, if we could dive off the board, swim out to the raft, and see who else was there to hang out with.</p>
